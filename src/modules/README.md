the only module here, `RepoAdd`, got replaced with a [container](https://github.com/vfeskov/win-a-beer-react/tree/master/src/containers/RepoAdd) since it's simpler and there isn't much justification for the module to exist.

nevertheless, i like this redux modular solution and it's kept for reference

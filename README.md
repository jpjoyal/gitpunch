## How to use

Make a list of repos on [Win a Beer](https://beer.vfeskov.com) and start watching :)

**Every hour** or **every day**, depending on your preferences, the notifier will check those and if there are new releases it will send a **single** email with all the news combined

To **unsubscribe** from emails just click on "*unsubscribe*" link in any of the emails. You **don't need to be logged in** to do this

## Further plans

1. Mute button next to each repo #13
2. Show repo versions, of which users were alerted already #14
3. Browser extensions to allow subscribing right from a GitHub page

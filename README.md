## How's it better than others

- Completely **open-source**
- **Realtime** updates: as soon as release happens you will get an email
- **Free** option to get emails **daily** instead of realtime
- **Star** any repo you want, no need to withhold affection if you don't care about releases
- More features to come: weekly emails, browser extensions, dashboard

# [Win A Beer](https://winabeer.com)

Watch for releases on GitHub. [Visit](https://winabeer.com) and learn the origin of the name ;)

## How it's better than others

- Completely **open-source**
- **Realtime** updates: as soon as release happens you will get an email
- **Free** option to get emails **daily** instead of realtime
- Register with multiple emails (e.g., email+important@example.com) and have **different watching lists** with their own settigns
- **Star** any repo you want, no need to withhold affection if you don't care about releases
- More features to come: weekly emails, browser extensions, dashboard
